              We at Guesser (“Guesser” “we,” or “us”) believe that your privacy is a fundamental right. We have written this privacy policy (this “Policy”) to reflect our values, and to clearly describe what information we collect from you when you use our specially-developed smart contracts to create, vote or validate at events, which can then be visualized on a website (www.guesser.io) that users can interact with (the “Site”), as well as how we protect and use that information. The smart contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in this Policy as the “Dapp”. By using the Dapp, you agree that we can collect, use, disclose, and process your information as described in this Policy. This Policy only applies to the Dapp, and not to any other websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to via the Dapp. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your information to them.
              While our values will not shift, the Dapp will evolve over time, and this Policy will change to reflect that evolution. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy. In some cases, if we make significant changes, we may give you additional notice by adding a statement to our homepage, or by sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about our practices.

              Information We Do Collect
              </p>
              <p>
              We will ask you to provide us with your email address, and your Ethereum wallet address.

              <p>
              We also collect basic analytics and log-in information when you use the Dapp. This information is collected by Google Analytics, and includes, among other things, the type of device you use, access times, IP address, hardware model, operating system and version, and other unique device identifiers. Some of these third-party providers may place cookies or pixels - small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory - on your browser or hard drive. Note that this Policy does not cover the use of cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default, but you can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If you do choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability to use the Dapp might be affected.

              <p>
              Depending on where you are located, your information may need to be transferred to different servers around the world as part of using the Dapp. Since we are based in Europe, any information we collect is governed by European law. You acknowledge that, as part of making the Dapp available to you, we may transfer your information to or maintain your information on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction. If you are located outside of Europe and you choose to provide your information to us, you agree that we have the right to transfer your information to Europe and process it there. By using the Dapp, or by otherwise providing any information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of that information in and to Europe, the U.S., and other countries.

              We take safeguarding your information extremely seriously. We will take reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures to help protect your information from loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. All that said, no method of transmitting or storing information over the Internet is completely secure. With that in mind, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
