            <h3>Terms of Use</h3>
            <p style="font-style: italic; color: gray;">Last Updated: April 24th, 2018</p>
            <div style="color: gray;">
              <p>Guesser is a distributed application (“Dapp”) that runs on the Rinkeby Test Network, using specially-developed smart contracts (each, a “Smart Contract”) to enable users to create, vote and validate Events, which can then be visualized on a website that the user can interact with (the “Site”). The Smart Contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Dapp”. Using the Dapp, users can participate in events by creating them and voting or validating an outcome.
              </p>
              <p>
              Guesser is making the Dapp available to you. Before you use the Dapp, the Smart Contracts, or the Site, however, you will need to agree to these Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated herein by reference (collectively, these “Terms").
              </p>
              <p style="text-transform: uppercase;">
              PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE DAPP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE DAPP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE. WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE DAPP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE DAPP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF THEM, OR BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW OR INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE IN AN ADJOINING BOX, YOU ARE CONFIRMING THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY’S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE DAPP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE DAPP, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE.
              </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold">
              1. The Dapp
              </p>
              A. To most easily use the Dapp, you must first install the Google Chrome web browser. Once you have installed Chrome, you will need to install a browser extension called MetaMask. MetaMask is an electronic wallet, which allows you to purchase (either directly via Coinbase if you are in the United States, or via other third party sites), store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You will not be able to engage in any transactions on the Dapp other than through MetaMask (or other Ethereum-compatible browsers). The Dapp will only recognize you as a user, and you will only be able to interact with the Dapp, if your Ethereum electronic wallet is connected and unlocked through your MetaMask account. There is no other way to sign up as a user, or to interact directly with the Dapp.
              <p>
              B. Transactions that take place on the Dapp are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the Dapp.
              </p>
              <p>
              C. We neither own nor control MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, the Ethereum network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the Dapp. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.
              </p>
              <p>
              D. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an account for the Dapp. You are responsible for the security of your account and your MetaMask wallet (and other Ethereum wallets and accounts). If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account with us, you agree to notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:team@guesser.io">team@guesser.io</a>.
              </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold">
              2. Fees and Payment
              </p>
              <p>
              A. Any financial transactions that you engage in using the Dapp will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network via via MetaMask. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Dapp, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum network or MetaMask.
              </p>
              <p>
              B. Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Dapp.
              </p>
              <p style="font-weight: bold">
              3. Ownership; Restrictions

              </p>
              <p>
              B. You may choose to submit comments, bug reports, ideas or other feedback about the Dapp, including without limitation about how to improve the Dapp (collectively, “Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, you agree that we are free to use such Feedback at our discretion and without additional compensation to you, and to disclose such Feedback to third parties (whether on a non-confidential basis, or otherwise).

              A. The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. 
              B. The Dapp does not store, send, or receive ether. Any transfer of funds occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not on the Dapp.

              </p>
              <p>
              C. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. 
              </p>

              D. A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of the Guesser ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
              E. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Guesser ecosystem.
              </p>
              <p>
              F. Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on the Guesser ecosystem.
