# Guesser: predict the outcome of the internet’s hottest events

Guesser is a prediction game where players put their ether on one of two outcomes of a given event, and the winning side gets back all the money played in the event. Events are created by players, who get a fee for their contribution, and are initially organized into 10 topics: Crypto, Celebrities, Entertainment, Gaming, Humour, News, Politics, Sports, Technology and Random.

## How to guess
If you think you know the outcome of a certain event, you can predict it by choosing one of the two outcomes and deciding how much ether you want to stake with Metamask. If the event finishes and you were right, the Guesser smart contract will give you the % of the total ether played (proportional to the % of your outcome’s pool) that you get back.

### Example:

1. Player X stakes 0.3 ether to Outcome A

2. Outcome A: 3 ether staked in total

3. Outcome B: 4 ether staked in total

4. Outcome A happens

5. Player X gets back (0.3 / 3 )*(3 + 4) = 0.7 eth

## How to create an event
To create an event, you simply click on "Create" at the top right corner of the page. You must set:

- Title

- Description

- Topic

- Outcome A

- Outcome B

- Event duration

- Ending date & time

For every player that plays at your event, you will keep a fee of the transaction that happens. This way you have an incentive to create quality events and attract players to them.

## Validation
In order to check the true outcome and provide an accurate result for an event in a decentralized way, validators are needed. Validators vote on what the true outcome was by staking their eth, and get rewarded through fees if they provide a majority answer. Validators lose their ether if their answer does not match the majority vote.
